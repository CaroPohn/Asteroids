# Asteroids

This game is a cute version of the classical game "Asteroid" made by me, Carolina Pohn.
This project was made in C++ using Raylib.

The idea was to maintain the same mechanics: a player that moves with some inertia and shoots at their enemies that split into two until they are small enough to break. Everything is manageable simply with the mouse.
